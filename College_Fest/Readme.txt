Hello Code Geeks......My Project is based on College_Fest.
In my Project was upon College_Fest which was authorized by Admin.
Admin has source to create Fest_Organisers and their account.Those Organisers has Fest_Cordinators from the representing Departments.
These Coodinators was work onside of Organisers Decision.
Organisers Account having the Participating Certificate to the Coordinators by signed by the Prinicipal of the College.
Admin can see how many Organisers was appointed and those organisers have how many coordinators can be viewed by admin.
In the Code you have to change the port number because i had returned the entire localhost url in (College_Event_org.jsp)file.
you have to change the database username,database password as per your using url and password.
I used oracle 11g xe edition.and the jdbcdriver is ojdbc8.
Entire Code is Available in my github account(https://github.com/Prudhvi-Nath).
